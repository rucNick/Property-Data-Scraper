# Property-Data-Scraper
This script uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape property data from "https://polaris3g.mecklenburgcountync.gov/address/". It navigates to each property's page by incrementing an ID in the URL, extracts the legal description and address, and saves the data into property_data.csv.
